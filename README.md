## How to Use This Plan Effectively

1. **Be active, not passive.**  
   For each new concept, solve at least 10–15 problems *before* checking any solution.

2. **Maintain an error log.**  
   Write down: topic, question type, mistake reason, correct idea. Review this across weeks.

3. **Revisit the core 20% regularly.**  
   Percentages, ratios, averages, T&W, TSD, basic DI, and LR puzzles should appear in your practice **every week**, not just where they first appear.

4. **Simulate exam conditions early.**  
   From Week 4 onwards, always practice at least one timed set daily, even if short (15–20 min).

If you tell me your target companies (e.g., TCS, Infosys, Wipro, product‑based, etc.), I can refine this plan further and suggest more specific PYQ‑style patterns for those tests.
