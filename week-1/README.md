Below is a structured Day 1–Day 7 plan for **Week 1 (Foundations, Percentages & Ratios)**.

Assume you can give about **2–3 hours per day**. If you have more/less time, keep the *sequence* the same but scale up/down the number of questions.

---

## Day 1 – Arithmetic Foundations & Percent Basics

**Focus:** Get comfortable with numbers, operations, and %–fraction–decimal conversions.

### 1. Warm‑up (20–25 min)

- Revise/learn:
  - Multiplication tables: 1–20
  - Squares: 1–25
  - Common fractions ↔ percentages:
    - 1/2 = 50%, 1/3 ≈ 33.33%, 1/4 = 25%, 1/5 = 20%, 1/8 = 12.5%, etc.
- Drill:
  - Do 20 quick mental calculations:
    - Examples: 17×5, 14×9, 25% of 80, 12.5% of 160, 0.25×200, etc.
  - Aim to do each in <10 seconds.

### 2. Concept Block 1 – What is a Percentage? (30–40 min)

Learn/clarify:

- Percentage = “per 100”.
- Conversions:
  - Fraction → %: divide numerator by denominator, ×100.
  - % → fraction: write over 100 and simplify.
  - % → decimal: divide by 100.

**Exercises (Beginner): 15–20 questions**

Problem Type A: **Fraction–Percentage Conversions**

- Examples:
  - Convert 3/4, 2/5, 5/8, 7/20 to percentages.
  - Convert 12.5%, 37.5%, 62.5% to fractions.
- **Key concepts:**
  - Comfort with dividing by 2,4,5,8,10,20,25.
  - Recognizing “nice” fractions: 1/4, 3/4, 1/8, etc.

Problem Type B: **Percentage–Decimal Conversions**

- Examples:
  - Convert 18%, 6.5%, 125% to decimals.
  - Convert 0.06, 1.2, 0.375 to percentages.
- **Key concepts:**
  - Moving decimal point correctly.
  - Understanding >100% and <1% cases.

> Try each question **without a calculator**, and only then check with one to confirm.

### 3. Concept Block 2 – Finding % of a Number (30–40 min)

Learn:

- To find x% of N:
  - Use fractions where possible:  
    e.g., 25% of 160 = 1/4 of 160.
  - Or use (x/100)×N and simplify.

**Exercises: 20 questions**

Problem Type C: **Direct Percentage of Quantity (Beginner)**

  - 10% of 350  
  - 18% of 250  
  - 7.5% of 640  
  - 62.5% of 96  
- **Key concepts:**
  - Breaking % into easy parts: e.g., 18% = 10% + 5% + 3%.
  - Using fraction equivalents: 12.5% = 1/8; 62.5% = 5/8.

> For each question, before using a formula, ask:  
> “Can I rewrite this as a simple fraction of the number?”

### 4. Short Timed Drill (10–15 min)

- Take **10 very simple questions** like:
  - 15% of 200
  - 40% of 450
  - 30% of 180

- Focus on:
  - Writing minimal steps.
  - Doing easy parts mentally.

### 5. Reflection (10–15 min)

- Note in a notebook:
  - Any % that confused you.
  - Any multiplication/division that felt slow.
- Write a tiny summary:
  - “To find % of a number quickly, I can…”

  “If a price is increased by 25% and then reduced by 20%, do we return to original?” (Answer: no → think why.)

### 2. Concept Block 1 – Successive Percentage Change (30–40 min)

Learn:

- If a quantity changes by `a%` then by `b%`, net change ≈ `a + b + (ab/100)%`.
- Or work with base 100:
  - Example: +20% then −10% → 100 → 120 → 108 (net +8%).

**Exercises: 15–20 questions**

Problem Type G: **Two Successive Changes (Medium)**

- Examples:
  1. Price increases by 20% and then 10%. Net % increase?
  2. Salary is cut by 10% then raised by 10%. Net effect?
  3. A shop gives 10% discount, then an extra 5%. Overall discount?
- **Key concepts:**
  - Using formula `net% = a + b + (ab/100)`.
  - Comparing with base‑100 method to verify.

> For first 5 problems, **do both methods** (formula and base‑100) to see equivalence.

### 3. Concept Block 2 – Reverse Percentage (Original Value) (30–40 min)

Learn:

- If final value is given after an increase:
  - Final = Original × (1 + x/100)  
  - Original = Final / (1 + x/100)
- Similarly for decrease.

**Exercises: 15–20 questions**

Problem Type H: **Finding Original Value (Medium)**

- Examples:
  1. After a 20% increase, a salary becomes 24,000. What was original?

  - 10 on percentages (mix of all types).
  - 10 on ratios (including mixed %–ratio).
  - 2–3 number series (LR).
- **Time:** 30 minutes recommended.

During the test:

- Don’t spend more than ~90 seconds on a single question initially.
- If stuck, mark it and move on.

### 4. Detailed Analysis (30–40 min)

For every question:

1. **Correct & fast (good):**
   - Ask: Can this be done even faster (mental, shortcut)?

2. **Correct but slow:**
   - Identify if you:
     - Wrote too many steps.
     - Used a “heavy” method instead of a simpler ratio/percent idea.

3. **Wrong:**
   - Classify reason:
     - Misread question?
     - Concept unclear?
     - Calculation mistake?
   - Immediately solve 1–2 *similar* problems correctly.

Make a short list:

- “Top 3 weak spots after Week 1”  
  (e.g., successive %, reverse %, ratio change problems).

You’ll target these again in later weeks.
