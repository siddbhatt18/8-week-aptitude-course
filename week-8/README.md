Here’s a structured **Week 8 (Day 1–Day 7)** plan focused on:

- Integrating everything you’ve learned (Quant + LR + DI/DS).
- Building **speed, accuracy, and question-selection strategy**.
- Practicing **mock tests + deep analysis**.

Assume ~**2–3 hours/day**. You can scale question counts, but try to keep the structure.

---

## Day 1 – Diagnostic Mini-Mock & Personalized Weakness Map

**Focus:** See where you currently stand, then build a targeted plan for the rest of Week 8.

### 1. Warm-up (15–20 min)

- 5 quick mental arithmetic questions (mixed):  
  - Percentages: 12.5% of 320, 35% of 180  
  - Fractions: 1/3 of 270, 3/5 of 250  
- 5 quick mental checks:
  - Recognize whether each is closer to 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0 in fraction (% intuition).
- Briefly scan your formula/shortcut sheet (2–3 minutes max).

---

### 2. Mini Mock 1 – Mixed Aptitude (45–50 min)

Design or pick a **mini mock**:

- 25–30 questions, 45–50 minutes:
  - 10 Quant:
    - 2–3 Percent/Ratios
    - 2 Averages / Profit–Loss
    - 2 Time & Work / Pipes
    - 2 Time–Speed–Distance
    - 1–2 Numbers/Algebra
  - 8 LR:
    - 1 small linear seating set (3–4 Q)
    - 1 tabular/attribute puzzle (3–4 Q)
  - 7 DI/DS:
    - 1 DI set (table or bar/line) – 3–4 Q
    - 3–4 DS questions (mix Yes/No + Value-type)

**Rules:**

- First pass: no more than ~90 seconds on a single question.
- Mark (but skip for now) any question you feel is “time sink” or confusing.

---

### 3. Detailed Analysis & Weakness Map (40–45 min)

Analysis is more important than the mock itself:

1. **Categorize each question**:
   - Correct & fast (≤ average time)
   - Correct but slow
   - Wrong (concept error / misread / silly calc)
   - Unattempted

2. **Tag by topic**:
   - E.g., “T&W – joining/leaving”, “Pie chart % conversion”, “Mixed DI”, “3-set Venn”, “Permutation vs Combination”, “Circular seating”, “DS with equations”.

3. Build your **Week 8 Target List**:
   - List **top 5 weak patterns** (e.g., “successive % discount”, “mixed pie+table DI”, “DS with arithmetic”, “circular seating mixed-facing”).
   - Rank them: W1 (worst) → W5.

You will use this list each day.

---

### 4. Targeted Micro-Practice (30–35 min)

Pick the **top 2 weaknesses** from your list (W1, W2).

For each:

- Do **5–7 focused questions** of that type (total ~10–14 questions).
- Fully untimed, but:
  - Solve carefully.
  - Try to recognize patterns/template structures.

---

### 5. Reflection (10–15 min)

Write 1 page:

- What went well in Mini Mock 1 (topics you’re confident in).
- The exact **error types** that appeared:
  - Misread question.
  - Wrong formula/approach.
  - Rushing → calc error.
- A sentence each for W1–W3:  
  - “When I see [type], I will first [strategy/diagram/approach].”

---

## Day 2 – Quant Speed & Core Topics Drill

**Focus:** Speed + accuracy in high-frequency Quant topics.

### 1. Warm-up (15–20 min)

- 10 rapid-fire calculations:
  - 4 on % increase/decrease.
  - 3 on averages / sum–average–count.
  - 3 on simple S = D/T or time–work (rate).
- Solve mentally or with minimal writing (aim ≤ 30–40 sec each).

---

### 2. Concept Review – 80/20 Quant (20–25 min)

Briefly revise main ideas (no deep theory, just triggers):

- Percent + Ratios + Averages.
- Profit–Loss–Discount.
- Time & Work, Pipes.
- Time–Speed–Distance, Trains, Boats.
- Basic Number Systems (LCM/HCF, remainders, unit digit).
- Linear equations & simple word-to-equation.

Just quickly skim formulas and 1–2 example patterns per topic.

---

### 3. Quant Drill 1 – Short / Medium Problems (30–35 min)

Solve **20–25 Quant questions**:

- Mix across topics above, with a bias toward your weak areas.
- Time: **30–35 minutes** (mild pressure).

Guidelines:

- If a question looks very calculation-heavy at first glance, skip & mark.
- Focus on:
  - Using ratios instead of heavy fractions.
  - Using complements (e.g., at least one = 1 − none).
  - Choosing simpler representations (work as LCM units, TSD distances as multiples).

---

### 4. Quant Drill 2 – Tougher / Multi-step Problems (20–25 min)

Now, choose **8–10 more challenging Quant questions**:

- 2–3 T&W with joining/leaving or mixed workers.
- 2–3 TSD with relative speed/trains/boats.
- 2–3 mixture/alligation or complex %/profit-discount.
- 1–2 tricky numbers/remainders or AP.

Do them **untimed**, but:

- Try different approaches:
  - Can you solve with rate equations vs unit work?
  - Can you simplify with approximation or ratios?

---

### 5. Independent Thinking Task (10–15 min)

- Pick 1 tough question you solved today.
- Rewrite it in your own words.
- Change one parameter (e.g., numbers, condition) and solve again.

This helps you recognize **pattern families**, not single questions.

---

## Day 3 – LR Focus: Arrangements, Puzzles & Selection

**Focus:** Speed and clarity in LR sets (linear, circular, tabular, selection).

### 1. Warm-up (10–15 min)

- Redo 1 easy:
  - Linear seating puzzle (small).
  - Tabular/attribute puzzle (2 attributes).
- Solve quickly to get into diagramming mode.

---

### 2. LR Drill 1 – Seating (Linear + Circular) (30–35 min)

- Do:
  - 2 linear seating sets (5–6 questions each).
  - 1 circular seating set (5–6 questions).

Time: **30–35 minutes** total.

Focus:

- Draw clean diagrams.
- Fix 1 reference person in circle.
- For mixed-facing problems, explicitly mark directions.

---

### 3. LR Drill 2 – Tabular & Selection Puzzles (30–35 min)

- 2 tabular puzzles (2–3 attributes each) – 4–6 questions each.
- 1 selection/committee puzzle – 3–4 questions.

Time: **30–35 minutes** (moderate pressure).

Guidelines:

- For tables: mark **X** clearly for impossible cells; don’t keep things in your head.
- For selection: write conditions as symbolic logic:
  - A & B cannot both be chosen → “NOT (A and B)”.
  - If C is in, D must be in → C ⇒ D.

---

### 4. Micro Review (10–15 min)

- For any set where you:
  - Got stuck.
  - Made a mistake.
  - Took too long.

Do:

- Redo just the **diagram** from scratch.
- Write in a sentence what went wrong:
  - Misread “immediate”.
  - Missed one constraint.
  - Poor choice of starting point.

This will tighten your LR method.

---

### 5. Optional Short LR Drill (if time, 10–15 min)

- 1 blood relation puzzle set (3–4 Q) OR 1 syllogism set (3–4 items).
- Solve quickly, aiming for clean diagrams or Venns.

---

## Day 4 – DI + DS Integration Day

**Focus:** Strong combined practice in DI & DS under time constraint.

### 1. Warm-up (10–15 min)

- 3 small % change problems.
- 3 quick average problems (for table/graph contexts).
- Recall DS process:
  - Check (1) alone.
  - Check (2) alone.
  - Then check (1)+(2).

---

### 2. DI Drill – Mixed Graphs (35–40 min)

Pick **3 DI sets**:

- 1 table-based.
- 1 bar or line graph.
- 1 pie or mixed (table + graph).

Total ~12–15 questions.

Time: **35–40 minutes**.

Focus:

- First 1–2 minutes: scan all sets, choose easiest-looking order.
- For each set:
  - Compute small helper totals/averages once and reuse them.
  - Approximate where exactness doesn’t matter (e.g., just ranking).

---

### 3. DS Drill – Mixed Types & Topics (30–35 min)

Solve **12–15 DS questions**:

- Mix:
  - Yes/No + Value-type.
  - Based on %/ratios, Time–Work, TSD, simple equations, divisibility.

Time: **30–35 minutes**.

Rules:

- For each question, **write tiny labels**:
  - “(1) alone?” – quick check.
  - “(2) alone?” – quick check.
  - “(1)+(2)?”.
- Never directly compute full numeric answers unless it truly helps deciding sufficiency.

---

### 4. Independent Thinking Task (10–15 min)

- Take any **one DI set** you did.
- Try to invent **2 new questions** based on the same data:
  - One about ratio/comparison.
  - One about % change or combined share.

- Take any **one DS question** and:
  - Edit statement (2) to make it:
    - Either “clearly sufficient alone”.
    - Or completely redundant.

This strengthens your understanding of what makes information “sufficient”.

---

## Day 5 – Full-Length Aptitude Mock 1 + Deep Analysis

**Focus:** Simulate a realistic test, then dissect performance.

### 1. Warm-up (10–15 min)

- Very light:
  - Glance at formula sheet (no heavy study).
  - 3–4 mental calculations just to wake up.

---

### 2. Full Mock 1 (60–75 min)

Design or choose a **full aptitude mock**:

- Aim: ~40–45 questions, **60–75 minutes**.
  Example split:
  - 15 Quant
  - 10 LR
  - 10 DI/DS
  - (If your target exams include Verbal, you may mix some in too, but focus here is apti.)

Rules:

- Follow exam-like conditions:
  - No phone/internet distraction.
  - Use only allowed rough paper and a pen.

Strategy during test:

- First 3–5 minutes:
  - Rapidly scan all questions/sets.
  - Mark:
    - “Sure & short”
    - “Medium”
    - “Time sink / maybe later”
- Attempt in order of easiest first.

---

### 3. Break (5–10 min)

- Step away.
- Don’t jump into solutions immediately.
- Reset your mind.

---

### 4. Deep Analysis Session (45–60 min)

Go question by question:

1. Mark:
   - Correct & fast.
   - Correct but slow.
   - Wrong (concept vs misread vs calc).
   - Unattempted.

2. For each **wrong or slow** question:
   - Identify the topic and sub-type.
   - Ask:
     - Was my first approach reasonable?
     - Is there a standard pattern/shortcut I should’ve used?

3. For each **DI or LR set**:
   - Re-draw the diagram/table more cleanly.
   - Check if bad diagram contributed to mistake or slowness.

4. Update your **Week 8 Target List**:
   - Add/adjust top weaknesses based on this full mock.
   - Some of your W1–W5 from Day 1 may be improved; others may appear.

---

### 5. Targeted Patch Practice (20–25 min)

From the mock:

- Choose **2 weakest topics** (e.g., “boats & streams”, “mixed pie DI”, “circular seating”).
- Do:
  - 5–6 questions each (10–12 total), slowly but correctly.

---

## Day 6 – Patch Day + Speed Rounds

**Focus:** Fix bad spots from Full Mock 1 and do speed drills across topics.

### 1. Warm-up (10–15 min)

- 5 quick questions specifically from your weakest mock topics (redo them from memory or from similar examples).
- The idea is to start by telling your brain “we’re fixing this”.

---

### 2. Patch Block – Focused Topic Repair (40–45 min)

Pick **2–3 top weaknesses** from Full Mock 1 analysis.

For each weakness:

- Revisit core idea briefly (5–7 minutes per topic).
- Then do **4–5 questions per topic** (total 12–15).

Examples:

- If weakness is “Trains – platform vs man vs train”:
  - Re-derive concept: distance = length or sum of lengths.
  - Solve 4–5 structured train problems.

- If weakness is “3-set Venn”:
  - Redraw generic 3-set Venn and go through 3–4 examples.

---

### 3. Speed Round 1 – Mixed Short Quant (20–25 min)

- 15–20 questions, targeting:
  - Simple but common types:
    - Single % or ratio.
    - Easy average / profit–loss.
    - Simple TSD / T&W.
- Time: **20–25 minutes**.

Goal:

- High accuracy with **low time per question**.
- Build “free marks” habit.

---

### 4. Speed Round 2 – Short Sets (20–25 min)

- Do:
  - 1 small LR set (3–4 Q).
  - 1 small DI set (3–4 Q).
  - 3–4 DS questions.

Time: **20–25 minutes**.

Focus:

- Fast reading of conditions.
- Clean diagrams.
- Quick sufficiency decisions.

---

### 5. Reflection & Strategy Update (10–15 min)

In your notebook:

- Write:
  - What types now feel **confident & quick**.
  - What types still feel **slow or shaky**.
- Define for tomorrow:
  - In Full Mock 2, I will:
    - Skip these patterns early if they appear (e.g., very wordy probability, heavy AP sums).
    - Prioritize these patterns early (e.g., single-step % problems, simpler DI sets).

---

## Day 7 – Full-Length Aptitude Mock 2 + Final Strategy

**Focus:** Second full mock + final tuning of exam strategy.

### 1. Warm-up (10–15 min)

- Light warm-up like Day 5:
  - Glance at formula sheet.
  - 3–4 mental calculation/logic questions.
- Mentally recap your **test strategy**:
  - Question selection.
  - Rough time allocation.

---

### 2. Full Mock 2 (60–75 min)

Take another **full aptitude mock**:

- Similar structure to Full Mock 1:
  - 40–45 questions, 60–75 minutes.
  - Include all areas: Quant, LR, DI, DS.

Follow refined strategy:

- First 3–5 minutes:
  - Quick scan.
  - Label Q’s by “Easy / Medium / Hard”.
- Attempt:
  - All “Easy” first (your comfort zones).
  - Then “Medium”.
  - Only touch “Hard” if time left.

---

### 3. Short Break (5–10 min)

- Reset before analysis.

---

### 4. Final Analysis (45–60 min)

- Same process as Day 5:
  - Categorize each question.
  - Analyze each mistake or slowdown.
- But especially focus on:

1. **Question selection quality**
   - Did you waste time on unsolvable/time-sink Qs early?
   - Did you leave “easy marks” unattempted?

2. **Time distribution**
   - Which section starved time?
   - Where did you overspend?

3. **Mental state**
   - Did you panic at some point?
   - Did you slow down too much after a mistake?

Write a short **Test-Day Strategy Note**:

- “In an actual exam, I will…”
  - Start with _______ section.
  - Spend at most _______ min on first pass.
  - Skip / flag questions of type ___________.
  - Aim for at least _______ attempts with ≥ _______ % accuracy.

---

### 5. Cool-down & Consolidation (15–20 min)

- Skim all your week’s notes:
  - Weakness lists.
  - Patterns you improved.
  - Strategy notes from both full mocks.
- Create a **one-page final cheat sheet** with:
  - Top formulas.
  - Top patterns (e.g., alligation, upstream/downstream, LCM for repeating events).
  - Top personal reminders (e.g., “Always check units”, “Draw diagram”, “Check (1) and (2) separately in DS”).

This is what you revise in the days right before actual online assessments.

---

You now have 8 weeks of structured preparation:

- Weeks 1–5: Core Quant & Basics.  
- Week 6: LR & Puzzles.  
- Week 7: DI & DS.  
- Week 8: Integration, mocks, and exam strategy.

If you share which specific companies/tests you’re targeting (e.g., TCS NQT, Infosys, Wipro, off-campus product-based tests), I can suggest how to tweak this Week 8 plan for their exact pattern (number of Qs, marking scheme, sections order).
