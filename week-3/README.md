Below is a structured **Week 3 (Day 1–Day 7)** plan, focused on:

- **Time & Work**
- **Pipes & Cisterns**
- **Time, Speed & Distance (TSD)**  
- **Relative Speed, Trains, Boats & Streams**

Assume ~**2–3 hours/day**. Keep the order of tasks even if you adjust durations.

---

## Week 3 – Day 1: Core Idea of “Rate” & Basic Time & Work

**Focus:** Understand “work rate” and solve basic Time & Work problems.

### 1. Warm‑up (15–20 min)

- 5 quick percent problems (from Week 1/2).
- 5 quick ratio problems (e.g., divide 300 in ratio 2:3, 4:5).
- 10 mental calculations:
  - Examples: 1/6, 1/8, 1/10 of 120, 240, 360, etc.

These help with fractions you’ll see as “work per day”.

---

### 2. Concept Block 1 – Work, Time, Rate (30–40 min)

Learn:

- Assume **total work = 1 unit** (or an easy common multiple later).
- If a person finishes work in **T days**, then:
  - Work rate = **1/T work per day**.
- Together:
  - Combined rate = sum of individual rates.

**Problem Type A: Basic T&W – 1 or 2 Workers (Beginner)**  
Solve 10–12 questions like:

1. A alone can complete a work in 10 days. How much work does A do in 1 day? In 5 days?  
2. A can finish the work in 12 days, B in 18 days. In how many days will they finish it together?  
3. A does 1/3 of the work in 4 days. In how many days can A finish the whole work?

Key concepts:

- Rate = 1/T.
- Together time = 1 / (1/T₁ + 1/T₂).
- Or, use LCM of times to set “total work” as an integer (e.g., LCM(12,18)=36 units).

> First 3–4 problems: write rates explicitly (like 1/12, 1/18).  
> After that, practice LCM method to see if it feels faster.

---

### 3. Concept Block 2 – Fraction of Work Completed (30–40 min)

**Problem Type B: Work Done in Given Days (Easy–Medium)**  
Solve 8–10 questions:

1. A alone can finish a job in 15 days. What fraction of work is done in 6 days?  
2. A & B together finish a job in 8 days. What part of the work do they complete in 3 days?  
3. If 3/5 of work is completed in 9 days by a single worker, how many total days to complete entire work?

Key concepts:

- Work done = rate × time.
- Remaining work = 1 − (work done).

---

### 4. Independent Thinking Task (10–15 min)

- Invent your own simple scenario:
  - For example: “Painting a wall”, “Typing pages”, “Building chairs”.
- Decide:
  - Time A alone takes, time B takes.
  - Then:
    1) How long together?  
    2) How much is done if only A works for 3 days, then A & B for 4 days?

Solve it fully. This helps you model real problems from scratch.

---

### 5. Short Timed Drill (10–15 min)

- 8–10 basic T&W questions (Types A & B).
- Time: **10 minutes**.
- Goal:
  - Get into habit of writing **rate first**, then solving.

---

## Week 3 – Day 2: Advanced Time & Work – Multiple Workers, Joining/Leaving

**Focus:** More workers, variable participation, and men–days–work logic.

### 1. Warm‑up (15–20 min)

- 5 problems from Day 1 (redo without notes).
- 5 quick mental “rate” thoughts:
  - Example: “If 4 people finish work in 12 days, how many ‘man‑days’ is that?” (Answer: 4×12=48 man‑days).

---

### 2. Concept Block 1 – Men–Days–Work & Worker Changes (30–40 min)

Learn:

- **Man‑days** concept: Work = number of workers × days.
- If work fixed:
  - More workers → fewer days, proportionally.

**Problem Type C: Men–Days Proportionality (Easy–Medium)**  
Solve 10–12 questions:

1. 6 men can finish a work in 15 days. In how many days will 10 men finish it?  
2. 8 men finish a work in 20 days. If after 5 days, 4 more men join, how many total days to complete work?  
3. If 15 men can finish work in 12 days, how many men needed to finish in 9 days?

Key concepts:

- Total work in man‑days = men × days.
- Use proportion: m₁d₁ = m₂d₂ when work is same.

---

### 3. Concept Block 2 – Joining/Leaving Worker During Work (30–40 min)

**Problem Type D: Phased Work (Medium)**  
Solve 8–10 questions:

1. A and B together can finish a work in 10 days. A alone can finish in 15 days. How long will B alone take?  
2. A and B start a work together. After 4 days, A leaves and B finishes in 6 more days. If A alone can finish in 12 days, find B’s time alone.  
3. A works alone for 3 days, then B joins and they finish in 5 more days. Given A alone would take 20 days, find the time B alone would take.

Key concepts:

- Break time into **phases** (Phase 1: A+B, Phase 2: only B, etc.).
- Compute work done in each phase = rate × time, then sum = 1.

---

### 4. Independent Thinking Task (10–15 min)

- Design 1 problem:
  - “X and Y start together, after ‘a’ days X leaves….”
  - Make sure to assign realistic numbers.
- Solve it fully.
- Then swap roles: X leaves, Y leaves, and see how answer changes.

---

### 5. Short Timed Drill (10–15 min)

- 8–10 questions mixing Types C & D.
- Time: **12 minutes**.
- Focus:
  - Drawing a small timeline for joining/leaving problems before doing math.

---

## Week 3 – Day 3: Pipes & Cisterns (T&W Variant)

**Focus:** Treat pipes as “workers” that fill or empty tanks.

### 1. Warm‑up (15–20 min)

- 5 T&W problems (redo quickly).
- Mentally convert:
  - “Fills tank in 6 hours → ? fraction per hour”  
  - For times: 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 hours.

---

### 2. Concept Block 1 – Basic Filling Pipes (30–40 min)

Learn:

- Exactly like T&W:
  - If pipe fills tank in T hours:
    - Rate = 1/T tank per hour.

**Problem Type E: Simple Pipes (Easy–Medium)**  
Solve 10–12 questions:

1. Pipe A fills a tank in 6 hours, Pipe B in 8 hours. Time to fill jointly?  
2. Pipe A fills in 10 hours. How much of the tank is filled in 4 hours?  
3. Two identical pipes each fill a tank in 12 hours. If both are opened, in how many hours is it filled?

Key concepts:

- Same as T&W with “days → hours” and “work → tank”.

---

### 3. Concept Block 2 – Pipes with Leakage / Emptying (30–40 min)

Learn:

- Outlet pipes have **negative rate** (they empty).
- Net rate = sum of all rates (filling positive, emptying negative).

**Problem Type F: Pipes + Leak / Emptying (Medium)**  
Solve 8–10 questions:

1. Pipe A fills a tank in 10 hours, Pipe B in 15 hours, and a leak empties it in 30 hours. Time to fill tank with all three open?  
2. A tank is filled by a pipe in 12 hours. Due to a leak, it takes 15 hours. In how many hours would the leak alone empty the full tank?  
3. Pipe A and B can fill a tank in 4 and 6 hours respectively, an outlet C empties in 12 hours. If all three are open, how long to fill?

Key concepts:

- Treat leak as doing negative work per hour.
- Solving for leak’s rate if net time is known.

---

### 4. Independent Thinking Task (10–15 min)

- Make a real‑world scenario:
  - Overhead tank, inlet, and leakage.
- Specify:
  - Filling time of main pipe.
  - Rate of leak so that observed total time matches your chosen number.
- Then convert your story into a standard math problem and solve.

## Week 3 – Day 4: Time, Speed & Distance – Basics

**Focus:** S = D/T, unit conversion, and basic single‑trip problems.

### 1. Warm‑up (15–20 min)

- 5 quick T&W/pipe questions (just to keep rate concept fresh).
- Recall:
  - 1 hr = 60 min, 1 min = 60 s.
  - 1 km = 1000 m.
- Revising:
  - Conversion: km/h ↔ m/s:  
    km/h to m/s → × (5/18)  
    m/s to km/h → × (18/5)

---

### 2. Concept Block 1 – Core TSD & Unit Conversion (30–40 min)

2. A man walks at 5 km/h. How far in 2.5 hours?  
3. A bike travels at 54 km/h. Convert this to m/s.  
4. A person runs at 10 m/s. What is that in km/h?

Key concepts:

- Correct use of formula.
- Unit consistency and correct 5/18, 18/5 multipliers.

---

### 3. Concept Block 2 – Average Speed (Equal/Unequal Distances) (30–40 min)

Learn:

- For a round trip with equal distances:
  - Average speed = (2ab)/(a + b) where a and b are two speeds.
- In general:
  - Average speed = (Total distance) / (Total time).

## Week 3 – Day 5: Relative Speed, Trains, and Boats & Streams

**Focus:** Objects moving with respect to each other and in moving mediums.

### 1. Warm‑up (15–20 min)

- 5 quick TSD basics from Day 4 (no notes).
- Recall:
  - Relative speed:
    - Same direction → |v₁ − v₂|
    - Opposite direction → v₁ + v₂

---

### 2. Concept Block 1 – Relative Speed & Train Problems (30–40 min)

Learn:

- For trains:
  - Distance covered to cross:
    - A point (man/pole) → length of train.
    - A platform → length of train + length of platform.
    - Another train → sum of lengths.

**Problem Type I: Trains & Relative Speed (Medium)**  
Solve 10–12 questions:

1. A 200 m train passes a man walking at 5 km/h in same direction in 20 s. Find speed of train.  
2. A 150 m train passes a pole in 15 s. Find speed in km/h.

- Use relative speed and correct distance (sum of lengths when both moving).

---

### 3. Concept Block 2 – Boats & Streams (30–40 min)

Learn:

- If boat speed in still water = b, stream speed = s:

  - 10–12 T&W (including joining/leaving).
  - 6–8 Pipes & Cisterns (including leaks).
- Time: **30–35 minutes**.

Focus:

- Quickly recognizing:
  - Whether to use man‑days or explicit rate addition.
  - When to break into phases.

---

### 5. Quick Analysis (15–20 min)

- For every incorrect/slow question:
  - Note if confusion was due to:
    - Mis‑reading time/worker data.
    - Wrong rate (e.g., forgetting minus for leak).
  - Re‑solve 2 similar ones correctly.

---

## Week 3 – Day 6: Mixed T&W + TSD Practice

**Focus:** Apply both Time & Work and TSD ideas in mixed practice under mild time pressure.

  - Combination of single worker, multiple workers, joining/leaving, pipes with leak.
- 7–8 TSD:
  - Basic S=D/T, average speed, simple relative speed, 1–2 train problems.

Do this **untimed**, but:

- For each, after solving, ask:
  - Could I spot the pattern faster next time?
  - Could I have written fewer equations?

---

### 3. Concept Block 2 – Slightly Tricky Patterns (30–40 min)

Focus on problems that combine ideas or require 2–3 steps:

**Problem Type K: Multi‑step T&W/TSD (Medium–High)**  
Solve 8–10 questions like:

1. A and B can finish a work in 12 days, B and C in 16 days, A and C in 24 days. How long will A, B, C together take?  
2. A car travels first half of distance at 40 km/h and second half at 60 km/h. In another trip, it travels first half time at 40 km/h and second half time at 60 km/h. Compare average speeds in both trips.  
3. Two trains of different lengths cross a platform, and some data about times are given; find one train’s length or speed.

Key concepts:

- System of equations on rates (for 3 workers).
- Being careful to distinguish distance‑half vs time‑half problems.
- Decomposing complex train questions into relative speed + correct distance.

---

### 4. Independent Thinking Task (10–15 min)

---

### 5. Short Timed Drill (10–15 min)

- 10 questions:
  - 5 T&W/Pipes, 5 TSD/Trains.
- Time: **12 minutes**.
- Target:

---

## Week 3 – Day 7: Consolidation & Second Sectional Test

**Focus:** Full revision and timed practice across all Week 3 topics.

### 1. Quick Revision (30–40 min)

Create a **2–3 page summary**:

- Time & Work:
  - Rate = 1/T, total work concepts.
  - Man‑days logic.
  - Joining/leaving, phase‑based approach.
- Pipes & Cisterns:
  - Fill/empty rates, leak as negative.
- TSD:
  - S = D/T, unit conversions.
  - Average speed; equal distance vs equal time.
- Trains:
  - Relative speed; distances as lengths or sum of lengths.
- Boats & Streams:
  - Upstream vs downstream speeds.

Keep this handy for future weeks as well.

---

### 2. Mixed Practice (20–30 min)

- 15–20 mixed questions, untimed:
  - 6–7 T&W/Pipes variety.
  - 6–7 TSD basics + relative speed.
  - 3–4 trains, 2–3 boats questions.

Focus on:

- Clean setups.
- Avoiding algebra when a ratio/proportional thinking works.

---

### 3. Sectional Test 2 – TSD + Trains + Boats (30–40 min)

Design or take a test:

- 18–22 questions:
  - 8–10 pure TSD (S=D/T, average speed, simple journeys).
  - 6–8 trains (crossing man, pole, platform, another train).
  - 3–4 boats & streams.

Time: **30–35 minutes**.

Rules:

- Max ~90 seconds per question in first pass.
- Skip questions that “look long” at first read; mark them to revisit.

---

### 4. Detailed Analysis (30–40 min)

Go through the test:

1. **Correct & Fast:**
   - Note what recognition helped: “Ah, equal distances → harmonic mean”, etc.

2. **Correct but Slow:**
   - Identify:
     - Too much writing?
     - Wrong initial approach?
   - Re‑solve 2 of these focusing *only* on speed.

3. **Wrong:**
   - Tag the reason:
     - Misread (e.g., mixed up upstream/downstream)?  
     - Concept gap (e.g., wrong relative speed direction)?  
     - Calculation slip?
   - Immediately do 2 fresh, similar problems correctly.

Finally, write:

- “Top 3 weaknesses after Week 3”  
  Examples:  
  - Trains: platform vs man confusion.  
  - Boats: setting equations for round trips.  
  - T&W: joining/leaving timeline.

These will be revisited in later mixed mocks.
