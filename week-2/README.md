## Week 2 – Day 1: Average Basics & Sum–Average–Count Link

**Focus:** What “average” really means and manipulating the basic formula.

### 1. Warm‑up (15–20 min)

- From Week 1:
  - 5 quick % of a number (e.g., 12.5% of 320, 40% of 350).
  - 5 quick ratio division (e.g., divide 300 in ratio 2:3).
- 10 quick mental sums:
  - Examples: 47+38, 126+179, 255+345, 389−167, etc.
  - Aim to do them in your head or with minimal writing.

### 2. Concept Block 1 – Definition of Average (30–40 min)

Learn / recall:

- **Average (Mean)** = (Sum of all observations) / (Number of observations).
- Therefore:
  - Sum = Average × Number of items.
  - Number of items = Sum / Average.

**Exercises: 15–20 questions**

**Problem Type A: Direct Average (Beginner)**  
Examples:

1. Find the average of 12, 15, 18, 20, 25.  
2. Find the average of 8, 14, 22.  
3. 6 students’ scores: 55, 60, 70, 65, 80, 90. Find average.

Key concepts:

- Comfortable mental addition.
- Dividing small sums correctly.

**Problem Type B: Using Average to Find Total (Beginner–Medium)**  
Examples:

1. Average of 10 numbers is 18. What is their total?  
2. The average age of 25 students is 16 years. What is the sum of their ages?  
3. A person spends an average of Rs. 250 per day for 12 days. Total expenditure?

Key concepts:

- Rewriting formula: Sum = Average × Count.
- Seeing “average” as “equal distribution”.

### 3. Concept Block 2 – Finding a Missing Number from Average (30–40 min)

**Exercises: 15–20 questions**

**Problem Type C: One Missing Value (Easy–Medium)**  
Examples:

1. Average of 5 numbers is 18. Sum of 4 of them is 70. Find the 5th.  
2. Average of 7 numbers is 14. When one number is removed, average becomes 13. What is the removed number?  
3. Average age of a group of 6 people is 30. A new person joins, and new average becomes 29. Find the age of new person.

Key concepts:

- Going from average → total → missing item.
- Understanding how adding/removing values changes the average.

> For every such problem, explicitly write:
> 1) What is the current number of terms?  
> 2) What is total sum?  
> 3) What changed?  

### 4. Independent Thinking Task (10–15 min)

- Create **2 of your own problems** of Type C:
  - Choose an average and number of items.
  - Pick one missing number.
  - Work backward to construct the given information.
- Then solve your own problems as if they were new.

This forces you to understand structure, not just copy types.

### 5. Short Timed Drill (10–15 min)

- 8–10 mixed questions from Types A/B/C.
- Time: **10 minutes**.
- Focus:
  - Minimal writing.
  - Quick use of Sum = Avg × Count.

---

## Week 2 – Day 2: Weighted & Combined Averages

**Focus:** Averages of groups and “weighted average” thinking.

### 1. Warm‑up (15–20 min)

- 5 quick “missing number” average questions from Day 1.
- 5 quick mental average estimations:
  - Example:  
    Numbers: 11, 13, 17, 19 → You know answer is near 15 (explain why).

### 2. Concept Block 1 – Combining Two Groups (30–40 min)

Learn:

- If Group 1: n₁ items, average a₁  
  Group 2: n₂ items, average a₂  
  → Combined average = (n₁a₁ + n₂a₂) / (n₁ + n₂)

**Exercises: 15–20 questions**

**Problem Type D: Combined Average (Medium)**  
Examples:

1. Class A has 20 students with average 60 marks; Class B has 30 students with average 70. Find combined average.  
2. A man’s average income for 4 months is Rs. 25,000 and for next 8 months is Rs. 30,000. What’s his average yearly income?  
3. Two groups have average ages 25 and 30, with 10 and 20 people respectively. Combined average?

Key concepts:

- Using weighted average rather than listing values.
- Recognizing that group with more members pulls combined average towards itself.

### 3. Concept Block 2 – Adding/Removing One Item (30–40 min)

**Exercises: 12–15 questions**

**Problem Type E: New Average after a Change (Medium)**  
Examples:

1. Average of 9 numbers is 50. A 10th number is added and new average becomes 52. What is the 10th number?  
2. Average weight of 8 persons is 60 kg. One person leaves and new average becomes 59 kg. What is the weight of the person who left?  
3. Average of 5 numbers is 40. If one extra number 55 is included, what is new average?

Key concepts:

- Think:  
  Old total → New total → Added/removed value.
- Relate difference in average to effect on total:
  - Change in total = change in average × number of items.

### 4. Challenge Task – Deviation Method (15–20 min)

Try for *thought*, not perfection:

- Idea: Average is like a “balance point”.  
  Example: For 10, 12, 14, 16:  
  - Average = 13; deviations are −3, −1, +1, +3 → sum of deviations = 0.
- Pick 3–5 small sets and check:
  - Sum of (value − average) = 0.

You don’t need to fully master deviation shortcuts yet; just build intuition that average is a “center”.

### 5. Short Timed Drill (10–15 min)

- 10 questions: mix Types D and E.
- Time: **12 minutes**.
- After, mark:
  - Where did you re‑compute sums unnecessarily?
  - Can you reuse old totals more cleverly?

---

## Week 2 – Day 3: Profit & Loss – Basics

**Focus:** CP, SP, Profit, Loss, and Profit/Loss % on Cost Price.

### 1. Warm‑up (15–20 min)

- 5 quick % change questions (Week 1 skills).
- 5 mental multiplications like:
  - 15% of 800, 20% of 1200, 5% of 360, etc.

### 2. Concept Block 1 – CP, SP, Profit, Loss (30–40 min)

Learn:

- CP = Cost Price, SP = Selling Price.
- Profit = SP − CP; Loss = CP − SP.
- Profit% = (Profit / CP) × 100  
  Loss%   = (Loss / CP) × 100

**Exercises: 15–20 questions**

**Problem Type F: Finding Profit/Loss and % (Beginner–Medium)**  
Examples:

1. CP = Rs. 1200, SP = Rs. 1500. Find profit and profit%.  
2. CP = Rs. 800, SP = Rs. 720. Find loss and loss%.  
3. A toy bought for Rs. 200 is sold for Rs. 260. Profit%?

Key concepts:

- Always use **CP** as base for %.
- Comfort with positive vs negative difference.

### 3. Concept Block 2 – Finding CP or SP from Given % (30–40 min)

**Exercises: 15–20 questions**

**Problem Type G: Reverse Use of Profit/Loss % (Medium)**  
Examples:

1. A trader earns 20% profit on an article. If CP is Rs. 500, find SP.  
2. A shopkeeper sells an item for Rs. 360 at 20% loss. Find CP.  
3. A dealer wants 25% profit and SP must be Rs. 250. What CP allows this?

Key concepts:

- SP = CP × (1 + profit%/100)  
- SP = CP × (1 − loss%/100)  
- CP = SP / (1 ± %/100)

### 4. Independent Thinking Task (10–15 min)

- Design 2–3 real‑like scenarios:
  - Buying in bulk and selling individually.
  - One with profit, another with loss.
- Don’t write answers immediately. First model the situation with CP, SP, % expressions, then plug numbers.

### 5. Short Timed Drill (10–15 min)

- 8–10 questions mixing Types F and G.
- Time: **10 minutes**.
- Check especially:
  - Did you ever use SP instead of CP in denominator by mistake?

---

## Week 2 – Day 4: Discounts, Marked Price & Combined % Effects

**Focus:** Marked Price (MP), Discount, and combining discount with profit/loss.

### 1. Warm‑up (15–20 min)

- 5 profit/loss calculations from Day 3 (redo from memory).
- 5 quick % of number calculations.

### 2. Concept Block 1 – Discount & Marked Price (30–40 min)

Learn:

- MP = Marked Price (list price).
- Discount = MP − SP.
- Discount% = (Discount / MP) × 100.

**Exercises: 12–15 questions**

**Problem Type H: Basic Discount (Easy–Medium)**  
Examples:

1. MP = Rs. 2000, discount = 10%. Find SP.  
2. An article sold for Rs. 1800 after 20% discount. Find MP.  
3. A shopkeeper offers 15% discount and sells item for Rs. 2550. Find MP.

Key concepts:

- Base for discount% is **MP**, not CP.
- Reverse % to go from SP to MP.

### 3. Concept Block 2 – Successive Discounts / Discount + Profit (30–40 min)

**Exercises: 12–15 questions**

**Problem Type I: Two Discounts / Profit with Discount (Medium–High)**  
Examples:

1. An item has MP Rs. 1000. Shop gives 10% discount, then an extra 5%. What is final SP and total discount%?  
2. A shopkeeper marks an article 25% above CP, then gives 10% discount on MP. Find his net profit%.  
3. MP is 2000. To get 12% profit on CP, he sells it after giving 10% discount on MP. Find CP.

Key concepts:

- Successive %: apply one after another, not add directly.
- Chain: CP → MP (with profit%) → SP (with discount%).
- Track each step clearly (write small arrows).

> For challenging ones, explicitly draw a flow:  
> CP → ×(1 + x%) → MP → ×(1 − y%) → SP

### 4. Independent Thinking Task (10–15 min)

- Take an everyday product (e.g., shoes):
  - Assume a CP.
  - Decide MP with some profit%.
  - Decide a discount to attract customers.
  - Compute final SP and net profit%.

This helps you see the logic behind retail pricing.

### 5. Short Timed Drill (10–15 min)

- 8–10 questions combining:
  - Discount only.
  - Profit + discount.
- Time: **10–12 minutes**.
- Afterward, look for any step where you confused MP, CP, SP.

## Week 2 – Day 5: Mixtures & Alligation (with Averages)

**Focus:** Treat mixtures as weighted averages; then learn the alligation rule.

### 1. Warm‑up (15–20 min)

- 5 combined average or new average questions.
- 5 quick % problems (particularly concentrations like 20%, 40%, etc.).

### 2. Concept Block 1 – Mixture via Average (30–40 min)

Learn:

- When mixing two things (e.g., liquids, grains) with values v₁ and v₂:
  - Mixture value = weighted average based on quantities.

**Exercises: 12–15 questions**

**Problem Type J: Two-Component Mixture (Medium)**  
Examples:

1. Mix 3 kg of rice at Rs. 40/kg with 5 kg of rice at Rs. 50/kg. Find price per kg of mixture.  
2. Two sugar solutions: 20% and 40%. Mix 2 L of first with 3 L of second. Find concentration of mixture.  
3. A shopkeeper mixes teas costing Rs. 200/kg and Rs. 280/kg in ratio 3:2. What is cost of mixture?

Key concepts:

- Using average = (sum of value) / (sum of quantity).
- Recognizing when ratio of quantity is given or must be found.

### 3. Concept Block 2 – Alligation Rule (30–40 min)

Alligation is a shortcut for finding **ratio of quantities**:

For two values v₁ and v₂, mixture value m:

- Left difference: (v₂ − m)
- Right difference: (m − v₁)
- Then quantities are in ratio: (v₂ − m) : (m − v₁)

**Exercises: 12–15 questions**

**Problem Type K: Alligation Problems (Medium–High)**  
Examples:

1. How much of a 20% solution and a 50% solution should be mixed to get 30% mixture? (Use alligation).  
2. Tea at Rs. 180/kg is mixed with tea at Rs. 260/kg to get mixture worth Rs. 220/kg. Find ratio of quantities.  
3. Milk (pure, 100%) and water (0%) are mixed to get 80% milk. In what ratio?

Key concepts:

- Remember: higher value – mean value on one side; mean – lower on other.
- Keep differences **positive**; ratio is always of quantities.

> For first few, solve **both** using weighted average and alligation to see they match.

### 4. Independent Thinking Task (10–15 min)

- Invent 2 mixture problems:
  - One with prices per kg.
  - One with percentages of solution.
- Solve using **both**:
  - Normal weighted average.
  - Alligation rule.

### 5. Short Timed Drill (10–15 min)

- 8–10 questions mixing Types J and K.
- Time: **12–15 minutes**.
- Focus: accurate setup; don’t rush to plug numbers before understanding which is higher/lower.

## Week 2 – Day 6: Intro to Data Interpretation (Tables & Bar Graphs)

**Focus:** Reading data, computing totals, averages, and % from tables/graphs.

### 1. Warm‑up (15–20 min)

- 5 quick average problems.
- 5 quick “percent of” questions (you’ll use them heavily in DI).

### 2. Concept Block 1 – Reading Tables (30–40 min)

Take a simple **table** (you can draw one):

Example structure:

| Year | Product A | Product B | Product C |
|------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| 2020 | 120       | 150       | 130       |
| 2021 | 140       | 160       | 150       |
| 2022 | 160       | 170       | 180       |

**Tasks:**

- Compute:
  - Total sales of each product across years.
  - Total for each year.
  - Average sales of Product A over 3 years.
  - % contribution of Product B in 2022 to total 2022 sales.

**Exercises: 3–4 such small tables with 4–5 questions each.**

Key concepts:

- Moving your eyes systematically (by row/column).
- Reducing re‑computation: store small sub‑totals as you go.

### 3. Concept Block 2 – Bar Graphs (30–40 min)

Draw or use a sample **bar graph**:

- X-axis: Years or Categories (e.g., Cities).
- Y-axis: Sales/Population.

**Exercises: 3–4 bar graph sets, 4–5 questions each.**

Question patterns:

1. In which year is the highest value?  
2. Difference in value between two years?  
3. % increase from one year to next.  
4. Average over a period.

**Problem Type L: DI from Table/Bar (Easy–Medium)**  
Key concepts:

- Translating visual heights / numbers into simple arithmetic.
- Applying your percentage & average skills in a new context.

> Don’t rush: first understand “what is being measured” on each axis and unit.

### 4. Approximation & Speed Thinking (10–15 min)

Pick 4–5 questions where **exact precision is not needed**, like:

- “Which city has the highest sales?”  
- “Which year had the maximum increase?”

Try to answer these by **eye and reasoning** first, then verify numerically.

This builds intuition and saves time in real tests.

### 5. Short Timed Drill (15–20 min)

- Choose 2 small DI sets (table or bar), total ~8–10 questions.
- Time: **15 minutes**.
- Practice:
  - Doing all easy questions in a set first.
  - Skipping any that look calculation‑heavy and returning later.

---

## Week 2 – Day 7: Consolidation + Sectional Test + Analysis

**Focus:** Integrate Averages + Profit–Loss + Mixtures + Simple DI.

### 1. Quick Revision (30–40 min)

From your notes, re‑write a compact summary:

- Averages:
  - Average, combined average, new average after addition/removal.
- Profit & Loss:
  - CP, SP, Profit/Loss %, Discount, MP, successive %.
- Mixtures:
  - Weighted average view; alligation diagram idea.
- DI:
  - How to systematically read table/graph and what to compute first.

### 2. Mixed Practice (30–40 min)

Solve **20–25 mixed questions**, roughly:

- 6–8 on averages (all types).
- 6–8 on profit/loss/discount.
- 4–5 on mixtures (including at least 2 alligation).
- 3–4 simple DI questions (from small table or bar graph).

Do this **untimed** but:

- Aim for clean and logical steps.
- After each question, ask:  
  “Could I have done this using a more direct formula/shortcut?”

### 3. Sectional Test Simulation (30–40 min)

Create (or take from a source) a small mock:

- **Total:** 20–25 questions:
  - 6–7 averages.
  - 6–7 profit–loss–discount.
  - 4–5 mixtures.
  - 4–6 DI (table/bar).
- **Time:** 30–35 minutes.

Rules:

- Do not exceed ~90 seconds on a single question initially.
- Mark questions you skip or find hard and move on.

This simulates placement test pressure lightly.

### 4. Deep Analysis (30–40 min)

For every question in the test:

- **Correct & fast:**  
  - Ask if you can spot a shorter path (e.g., ratio thinking instead of heavy algebra).

- **Correct but slow:**  
  - What ate time? Long arithmetic? Confused setup?  
  - Re‑solve once focusing only on speed.

- **Wrong:**  
  - Classify:
    - Misread problem?
    - Conceptual gap (e.g., used CP instead of MP)?
    - Calculation slip?
  - Immediately solve **2 similar** questions correctly.

Finally, write:

- “Top 3 areas to fix before moving on to Week 3”, such as:
  - Combined average with three groups.
  - Profit after discount and markup.
  - Alligation ratio setup.

You’ll revisit these weak spots in future mixed practice and mocks.
