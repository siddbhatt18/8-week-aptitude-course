   - Identify why:
     - Too much writing?  
     - Started with a clumsy method (e.g., long division vs using remainders)?  
   - Re‑solve 2–3 of these focusing *only* on speed.

3. **Wrong:**

     - Algebra mistake (sign error, moving terms)?  
     - Misapplied rule (e.g., inequality direction)?
