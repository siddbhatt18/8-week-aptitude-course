Here’s a structured **Week 7 (Day 1–Day 7)** plan focused on:

- **Data Interpretation (DI):** tables, bar graphs, line graphs, pie charts, mixed graphs  
- **Data Sufficiency (DS):** Yes/No and Value-based questions using your Week 1–6 concepts  

Assume ~**2–3 hours/day**. Adjust question counts if needed, but keep the sequence and structure.

---

## Day 1 – DI Foundations: Tables, Averages & Percent Change

**Focus:** Learn how to read tables quickly and use averages/% change within them.

### 1. Warm-up (15–20 min)

Revise core skills you’ll use in DI:

- 5 quick percentage problems (increase/decrease/percentage of a number).
- 5 quick average problems (sum–average–count).
- 5 quick ratio/part–whole checks.

Aim: get back into fast arithmetic mode.

---

### 2. Concept Block 1 – Reading & Interpreting Tables (30–40 min)

Learn:

- Identify:
  - Rows = usually entities (years, products, people).
  - Columns = attributes (sales, units, marks).
- Always ask:
  - What are the **units**? (thousands? lakhs? %)  
  - What exactly is each number representing?

**Problem Type A: Single-Table DI (Beginner–Medium)**  
Create/choose simple tables (4–5 rows, 3–4 columns). For each table, answer 4–6 questions.

Example structure:

Table: Sales (in 1000 units)

| Year | Product A | Product B | Product C |
|------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| 2020 | 120       | 150       | 130       |
| 2021 | 140       | 160       | 150       |
| 2022 | 160       | 170       | 180       |

Questions like:

1. Total sales of Product A over all years?  
2. In which year were total sales (A+B+C) maximum?  
3. What is the average sales of Product B over 3 years?  
4. What % of total 2022 sales was from Product C?

Do this for **3–4 such tables** (12–18 questions total).

Key concepts:

- Scanning rows/columns systematically.
- Doing additions/averages **without** re-reading the entire table each time.
- Using percentage and average in context.

---

### 3. Concept Block 2 – Percentage Change from Table Data (30–40 min)

Focus on:

- % change = (New − Old) / Old × 100
- Often used for year-on-year or category comparisons.

**Problem Type B: % Change & Comparisons (Medium)**  
Using the same or similar tables, answer 8–10 dedicated questions:

Examples:

1. What is the % increase in Product A sales from 2020 to 2022?  
2. Between 2020 and 2021, which product had the highest % growth?  
3. For which year was the overall % increase in total sales (compared to previous year) the highest?

Key concepts:

- Identify correct “Old” vs “New”.
- Compare growth in **%**, not just absolute numbers.

---

### 4. Independent Thinking Task (10–15 min)

- Take any real small table:
  - Your own marks over 3 exams in 3 subjects, or
  - Hypothetical company revenues for 3 products over 3 years.
- Write:
  - 3 questions about totals/averages.
  - 2 about % change.
- Then solve them.

This makes DI feel like information processing, not a trick.

---

### 5. Short Timed Drill (10–15 min)

- Pick 2 small tables, total **8–10 questions**.
- Time: **10–12 minutes**.
- Focus:
  - Mark questions that require **long calculations** and see if there are shortcuts (e.g., compare ratios instead of computing all).

---

## Day 2 – Bar Graphs: Visual Comparison & Fast Arithmetic

**Focus:** Read and compare values from bar charts.

### 1. Warm-up (10–15 min)

- 5 quick mental fraction-to-percent or percent-to-fraction conversions.
- 5 quick difference/ratio computations (e.g., 340 vs 400, which is bigger by what %).

---

### 2. Concept Block 1 – Single Bar Graphs (30–40 min)

Learn:

- Axes:
  - X-axis: categories (years, cities, products).
  - Y-axis: values with scale.
- Types:
  - Vertical bars (most common).
  - Sometimes stacked/multiple bars.

**Problem Type C: Single Bar Graph DI (Easy–Medium)**  
Use 3–4 different bar graphs, 4–6 questions each (total ~15–20 questions).

Example structure:

Bar graph: Sales (in lakhs) of a company from 2018–2022.

Questions:

1. In which year were sales maximum?  
2. What is total sales over 5 years?  
3. What is average annual sales?  
4. Between which two consecutive years was the largest increase?  
5. What % of total 5-year sales occurred in 2021?

Key concepts:

- Approximate reading if exact values not critical.
- Minimize re-reading scales by writing down key values once.

---

### 3. Concept Block 2 – Double/Clustered Bar Graphs (30–40 min)

Two bars per category (e.g., Sales & Profit, or Company A & B).

**Problem Type D: Double Bar Graph DI (Medium)**  
Use 2–3 such graphs, 5–6 questions each (10–15 questions).

Example: Sales of Company A & B from 2019–2022.

Questions:

1. In which year is difference in sales between A & B greatest?  
2. In which year is combined sales maximum?  
3. Over all years, which company sold more in total?  
4. What is the ratio of total sales of A to B over 4 years?

Key concepts:

- Comparing heights quickly.
- Doing row-wise and column-wise totals (per year vs per company).

---

### 4. Independent Thinking Task (10–15 min)

- Sketch a simple bar graph yourself:
  - Choose 5 categories (e.g., 5 cities and their populations).
- Write:
  - 3 comparison questions (max, min, rank).
  - 2 % or ratio questions.
- Solve them.

Understanding from graph creation helps reading later.

---

### 5. Short Timed Drill (10–15 min)

- Choose 2 bar-graph sets (one single, one double), total 8–10 questions.
- Time: **12 minutes**.
- Focus:
  - Quickly identify which questions are **direct look-up** (no heavy calculation) vs which need arithmetic.

---

## Day 3 – Line Graphs & Mixed (Table + Graph) Sets

**Focus:** Trend analysis and multi-graph interpretation.

### 1. Warm-up (10–15 min)

- 5 quick average speed or % change mental problems (to warm arithmetic).
- Revisit 1 bar graph or table from previous days and answer 2–3 questions mentally.

---

### 2. Concept Block 1 – Line Graphs (30–40 min)

Learn:

- X-axis: usually time (months, years).
- Y-axis: value (sales, production).
- Multiple lines: multiple entities.

**Problem Type E: Line Graph DI (Medium)**  
Use 3–4 line graph sets, 4–6 questions each (~15–20 questions).

Example: Monthly production of a factory Jan–Jun.

Questions:

1. In which month is production highest? Lowest?  
2. Between which months is production increase largest?  
3. What is average monthly production over the period?  
4. In which months is production above average?

Key concepts:

- Observing **trends** (increasing, decreasing).
- Using visual slope to guess where change is greatest, then checking numbers.

---

### 3. Concept Block 2 – Mixed DI (Table + Graph or Double Line/Bar) (30–40 min)

Here DI may combine:

- Table for quantities.
- Graph for % values (e.g., Profit%).

**Problem Type F: Mixed-Source DI (Medium–High)**  
Work through 2–3 such sets, 5–7 questions each (10–15 questions).

Example:

- Table: Revenues of companies A, B over years.
- Line graph: Profit% for each company by year.

Questions:

1. Profit in a given year (Revenue × Profit%).  
2. Compare profits of A & B over 3 years.  
3. Year with maximum profit for a company.  
4. Total profit over period.

Key concepts:

- Using one source (e.g., % from line graph) to compute values on another (table).
- Break problems into steps:
  - Step 1: Read year & company data.
  - Step 2: Compute missing quantity (profit, cost, etc.).

---

### 4. Independent Thinking Task (10–15 min)

- Design a 2-line graph:
  - Example: marks of Student A and B across 5 tests.
- Then:
  - Write 4–5 questions: best/worst test, who improved more, etc.
  - Answer them.

This helps you see what information line graphs naturally convey.

---

### 5. Short Timed Drill (10–15 min)

- 8–10 questions:
  - 5–6 from line graphs.
  - 3–4 from a mixed table+graph DI set.
- Time: **12–15 minutes**.
- Aim:
  - Identify at a glance: “Do I need to compute anything here, or is it just comparison/reading?”

---

## Day 4 – Pie Charts & Approximation in DI

**Focus:** Pie charts (angle/percentage) and improving speed via smart approximation.

### 1. Warm-up (10–15 min)

- Recall:
  - Full circle = 360° = 100%.  
  - 1% = 3.6°.  
- Quick conversions:
  - 25%→ 90°, 50%→ 180°, 10%→ 36°, etc.

---

### 2. Concept Block 1 – Single Pie Chart (30–40 min)

Learn:

- Each sector can be given as:
  - Angle in degrees, or
  - Percentage, or
  - Actual values.
- If only angles or % are given + total sum, you must compute absolute values.

**Problem Type G: Single Pie Chart DI (Medium)**  
Use 3–4 pie charts, 4–6 questions each (~15–20 questions).

Example:

- Pie chart: Market share of 5 companies (A–E), given as angles or %.
- Total market size given.

Questions:

1. What is actual revenue of Company A (if total market is, say, 1000 crores)?  
2. Which company has largest/smallest share?  
3. What is combined share (or revenue) of A and C?  
4. What is ratio of shares of B to D?

Key concepts:

- Converting angle to % → (Angle/360)×100.
- Multiplying that % with total to get actual number.

---

### 3. Concept Block 2 – Pie + Table / Double Pie (30–40 min)

More complex:

- Pie for percentage distribution.
- Table for yearly totals.

**Problem Type H: Combined Pie + Table (Medium–High)**  
Work with 2–3 such sets, 5–7 questions each (~10–15 questions).

Example:

- Table: Total sales for years.  
- Pie chart: Category-wise % split for one particular year.

Questions:

1. Category A sales in 2020 = total 2020 sales × A’s % in pie.  
2. Compare category A sales between different years.  
3. If an extra year or new category is added, how does share change?

Key concepts:

- Multi-step: table → pie% → value.
- Some questions might only ask relative comparisons (no need to calc exact numbers if only ordering matters).

---

### 4. Approximation Skill Task (10–15 min)

Pick 4–5 questions across any DI type (bar, line, pie) that:

- Ask for largest/smallest/approx %.

Try to:

- Estimate answers **without** full calculation:
  - Round numbers sensibly.
  - Compare visually (which bar clearly taller?).

Then check:

- How often your estimate matches the correct option.

This builds exam-time intuition.

---

### 5. Short Timed Drill (10–15 min)

- 8–10 questions: mostly pie-based, with some requiring conversion to exact values.
- Time: **12–15 minutes**.
- Focus:
  - Write minimal steps (especially for repeated % conversions; reuse intermediate results when possible).

---

## Day 5 – Introduction to Data Sufficiency (DS) + Light Mixed DI

**Focus:** Understand DS question format and basic “sufficiency” logic.

### 1. Warm-up (10–15 min)

- 5 quick arithmetic/linear equation questions (1–2 steps).
- Reminder: DS is about “Do we have enough info?”, not “What is the answer?”.

---

### 2. Concept Block 1 – DS Basics & Yes/No Type (30–40 min)

Learn DS format:

- A question + two statements (1) and (2).
- You must decide:
  - (1) alone sufficient?  
  - (2) alone sufficient?  
  - Both together necessary?  
  - Neither sufficient?

Start with Yes/No questions:

**Problem Type I: DS – Yes/No (Beginner–Medium)**  
Solve 10–12 questions.

Examples:

1. Is x > 5?  
   (1) 2x − 3 > 7  
   (2) x is an integer.  
2. Is number N divisible by 3?  
   (1) Sum of digits is 12.  
   (2) Last digit is 6.  
3. Is A older than B?  
   (1) A is 5 years older than C, who is 2 years younger than B.  
   (2) A’s age is 20.

Key concepts:

- Don’t find the exact answer, just see if one **unique Yes/No** conclusion can be made.
- Carefully check each statement alone before combining.

---

### 3. Concept Block 2 – DS Value-Type Questions (30–40 min)

Questions like: “What is the value of x?”

**Problem Type J: DS – Value Type (Medium)**  
Solve 10–12 questions.

Examples:

1. What is x?  
   (1) 3x + 2 = 17  
   (2) 2x − 3 = 9  
2. What is the length of the rectangle?  
   (1) Perimeter is 40 and breadth is 8.  
   (2) Area is 96 and breadth is 8.  
3. What is the average of 3 numbers a, b, c?  
   (1) a + b + c = 30  
   (2) 2a + 2b + 2c = 60

Key concepts:

- Check if a statement (alone or together) gives a **unique** value solution.
- Beware of:
  - Infinite solutions (e.g., one equation in two unknowns).
  - Contradictory information.

---

### 4. Light Mixed DI Practice (15–20 min)

- Do 1–2 small DI sets (table/bar/line), 3–4 questions each (6–8 questions).
- Untimed, focus on:
  - Clear reading & minimal recalculation.

This keeps DI fresh while you’re learning DS.

---

### 5. Short Timed Drill – DS Only (10–15 min)

- 8–10 DS questions (mix Type I & J).
- Time: **10–12 minutes**.
- Objective:
  - Strictly separate:
    - Checking statement (1) alone.
    - Checking statement (2) alone.
    - Then (1)+(2).
  - Don’t jump to combined directly.

---

## Day 6 – DS with Arithmetic/Algebra + Mixed DI Practice

**Focus:** Slightly tougher DS and integrate DI under time.

### 1. Warm-up (10–15 min)

- 3–4 quick DS questions from Day 5 (redo without notes).
- 3–4 mental linear equation/average questions.

---

### 2. Concept Block 1 – DS with Arithmetic/Algebra Context (30–40 min)

Use topics from previous weeks: %, ratios, averages, T&W, TSD, etc.

**Problem Type K: DS with Quant Concepts (Medium–High)**  
Solve 12–15 questions.

Examples:

1. What is the percentage profit on an article?  
   (1) CP = 200, SP = 250.  
   (2) Profit = 50.  
2. How many students are in the class?  
   (1) 40% are girls; there are 24 girls.  
   (2) Ratio of boys to girls is 3:2 and there are 24 girls.  
3. How long will A and B together take to finish a work?  
   (1) A can finish in 10 days; B can finish in 15 days.  
   (2) A does half the work and B does half the work.

Key concepts:

- Apply DS sufficiency logic to familiar quant problems.
- Often one statement **alone** is enough; check carefully.

---

### 3. Concept Block 2 – Mixed DI (Moderate Difficulty) (30–40 min)

- Choose 2–3 DI sets (any types: tables, bars, lines, pies, mixed).
- Each with 4–6 questions → total ~12–15 questions.
- Do these with moderate time pressure:
  - e.g., 25–30 minutes total.

Focus:

- Efficient method selection:
  - Use approximation when only ranking is needed.
  - Avoid full exact computations if not required.

---

### 4. Independent Thinking Task (10–15 min)

- Create 2 DS questions on your own:
  1. One Yes/No type (e.g., “Is N divisible by 4?”).  
  2. One Value type (e.g., “What is man’s speed?” with TSD-style info).
- Write statements (1) and (2) so:
  - Each alone is not enough.
  - Together they are sufficient.

This forces you to deeply understand what “sufficient” means.

---

### 5. Short Timed Drill (10–15 min)

- 6–8 DS questions + 4–5 DI questions (mixed).
- Time: **15 minutes**.
- Goal:
  - Maintain accuracy while switching between DS and DI thinking.

---

## Day 7 – Full DI + DS Sectional Test & Analysis

**Focus:** Integrate Week 7 skills in an exam-like environment and analyze.

### 1. Quick Revision (25–30 min)

From your notes, build a 2–3 page cheat sheet:

- DI:
  - Typical questions for tables, bars, lines, pies.
  - % change, ratio, average calculations.
  - Approximations & when they’re safe.
- DS:
  - Steps: Check (1) alone → (2) alone → both → neither.
  - Yes/No vs Value-type.
  - Common traps: underdetermined systems, redundant info, contradictory statements.

---

### 2. Mixed Practice (20–25 min)

- 12–15 untimed questions:
  - 8–10 DI (2–3 small sets).
  - 4–5 DS.

Focus:

- Clean layout.
- Minimal re-reading of questions.
- Writing only the essential calculations.

---

### 3. Sectional Mock – DI + DS (35–45 min)

Create or take a small test:

- **Total:** 24–28 questions:
  - 4 DI sets (tables/bar/line/pie/mixed) with 4–5 questions each → 16–20 questions.
  - 8–10 DS questions (mix Yes/No and Value-type).

**Time:** 35–40 minutes.

Strategy:

- First 3–4 minutes:
  - Quickly scan all DI sets.
  - Pick easiest-looking set (clear numbers, fewer categories).
- Do DI sets in order of perceived ease.
- For DS:
  - Don’t over-calculate; focus on structure and sufficiency.

---

### 4. Detailed Analysis (30–40 min)

After finishing:

1. **Score & Timing Check**
   - How many DI vs DS attempted?
   - Which consumed more time?

2. **DI Analysis**
   - For each set:
     - Were there questions you misread?  
     - Did you calculate more than needed (e.g., get exact when only comparison needed)?  
   - Re-solve any:
     - Wrong questions.
     - Correct-but-very-slow questions using a faster approach.

3. **DS Analysis**
   - For each DS question:
     - Did you systematically check (1) alone, (2) alone, (1)&(2)?  
     - Where did you assume instead of proving sufficiency?
   - Reclassify each statement properly and verify.

4. **Write Your Top 3 Weaknesses for Week 7**
   Examples:
   - Pie chart % → actual conversion slow.  
   - Mixed table+graph DI confusion.  
   - DS: forgetting to test each statement alone.  

These weaknesses guide your targeted revision during full mocks in Week 8.

---

If you want, I can now outline **Week 8 (Integration, full mocks, speed strategy)** with specific day-wise tasks for revision, mixed practice, and test-taking strategy.
