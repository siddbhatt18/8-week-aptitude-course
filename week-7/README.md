Here’s a structured **Week 6 (Day 1–Day 7)** plan focused on **Logical Reasoning – Arrangements & Puzzles**:

- Linear & circular seating  
- Tabular puzzles (people vs city vs color/type)  
- Selection with conditions  
- Blood relations  
- Syllogisms / basic logic  

Assume ~**2–3 hours/day**. Adjust counts if needed, but keep the order and progression.

---

## Day 1 – LR Foundations: Representation & Simple Ordering

**Focus:** Learn how to represent information clearly and solve basic ordering/position puzzles.

### 1. Warm-up (15–20 min)

- Do 3–4 very short reasoning questions:
  - Odd-one-out (e.g., which word doesn’t belong: apple, banana, carrot, mango).
  - Simple pattern (1, 3, 5, 7, ?).
- Goal: wake up your “pattern spotting” brain, not to memorize anything.

---

### 2. Concept Block 1 – How to Represent Constraints (30–40 min)

Learn:

- Always convert words → **diagram/table/list**.
- Common tools:
  - Numbered slots: `__  __  __  __  __` for positions.
  - Arrow/timeline for “before/after”.
  - Simple table for attributes (Name / Rank / City).

**Problem Type A: Simple Ordering (Beginner)**  
Solve 8–10 questions like:

1. Five friends A, B, C, D, E finished a race. A finished before C. B finished before D. E finished after C but before D. Find possible orders.  
2. Four books P, Q, R, S are on a shelf from left to right.  
   - P is left of Q,  
   - R is left of S,  
   - Q is not at either end.  
   What are possible orders?

Key concepts:

- Translating statements into **relative positions**:
  - “Before/after” → left/right or earlier/later.
- Keeping multiple candidate orders if not uniquely determined.

> For each problem:
> - Write positions (1, 2, 3, …).  
> - Use arrows (A → C means A before C).  
> - Only then try completions.

---

### 3. Concept Block 2 – Introduction to Linear Seating (Small Sets) (30–40 min)

Start with:

- People sitting in a row facing **same direction** (e.g., all facing north).
- Phrases:
  - “Immediate left/right” = neighboring seat.
  - “Two persons between A and B” = there is a gap of exactly 2.

**Problem Type B: Small Linear Seating (Beginner)**  
Solve 8–10 questions (5–6 people max):

1. 5 people A, B, C, D, E sit in a row facing north.  
   - B is to the immediate right of A.  
   - C is at one of the ends.  
   - D is not next to E.  
   Find all possible arrangements.  
2. 4 people W, X, Y, Z sit in a row.  
   - W is somewhere to the left of X.  
   - Y is immediately right of Z.  
   List valid seatings.

Key concepts:

- Number slots: _1  2  3  4  5_
- Try fixing a “strong” condition first (like “at end” or “immediate right”).
- Eliminate patterns that conflict with any constraint.

---

### 4. Independent Thinking Task (10–15 min)

- Make your own tiny puzzle:
  - 4 or 5 friends sitting in a row.
  - Write 3–4 constraints (e.g., “A is not at the end”, “B sits to the right of C”, etc.).
- Try to solve it as if you didn’t write it:
  - Draw slots.
  - Use logical elimination.

This teaches you what kind of constraints are sufficient/insufficient.

---

### 5. Short Timed Drill (10–15 min)

- 6–8 very small ordering/linear puzzles (Types A & B).
- Time: **10–12 minutes**.
- Goal:
  - Draw diagrams quickly.
  - Avoid trying to solve everything in your head.

---

## Day 2 – Linear Seating: Single Row, More Constraints

**Focus:** Become comfortable with 1-row seating with multiple constraints.

### 1. Warm-up (10–15 min)

- Redo 2–3 puzzles from Day 1 (without looking at old diagrams).
- Focus on:
  - Slot drawing speed.
  - Interpreting “immediate”, “between”, “not next to”.

---

### 2. Concept Block 1 – Standard Linear Arrangement Strategy (30–40 min)

Strategy steps:

1. Draw empty slots (number of people).  
2. Place the **most restrictive** clues first:
   - “X is at an end”.
   - “Y sits third from left”.
   - “Z sits between A and B”.
3. Use “not next to”, “not at end” to eliminate impossible positions.
4. If needed, keep **multiple diagrams** for different cases.

**Problem Type C: Linear Seating – Standard (Medium)**  
Solve 8–10 questions:

Typical pattern:

1. 7 people A–G sit in a row facing north. Conditions like:
   - A sits third from the left.
   - C is to the immediate right of D.
   - E is at one of the ends.
   - B does not sit next to A.
   - etc.  
   Determine final order or answer queries like “Who sits between X and Y?”  
2. 6 people with at least 4–5 constraints (position + left/right relations).

Key concepts:

- Systematic placement (not random guessing).
- Using cross marks (X) in slots to mark impossible positions.

---

### 3. Concept Block 2 – Linear Seating with Additional Attribute (30–40 min)

People + one more property (e.g., color, city).

**Problem Type D: Linear + Attribute (Medium–High)**  
Solve 5–7 questions:

Example structure:

1. 5 people P, Q, R, S, T sit in a row. Each likes a different fruit: Apple, Banana, Mango, Orange, Grapes.  
   - P is not at an end and likes neither Mango nor Orange.  
   - The one who likes Apple sits at the left end.  
   - Q sits immediately right of the Mango lover.  
   - etc.  
   Find who likes what and where they sit.

Key concepts:

- Combine a **row** diagram + small **table** (Person vs Fruit).
- Fill what you are sure of; mark impossible cells with X.

---

### 4. Independent Thinking Task (10–15 min)

- Pick one puzzle you solved.
- Change one condition slightly (e.g., “A sits second from left” → “A sits at an end”).
- Redraw and see:
  - Does it become easier/harder?
  - Does it now have multiple solutions?

This builds intuition about how strong a constraint is.

---

### 5. Short Timed Drill (10–15 min)

- 5–6 linear seating puzzles (2–3 normal, 2–3 with attributes).
- Time: **12–15 minutes**.
- Focus:
  - Don’t be afraid to start a new diagram if the first gets messy.

---

## Day 3 – Circular Seating (Facing In/Out)

**Focus:** Circular arrangements, relative positions, and facing directions.

### 1. Warm-up (10–15 min)

- Recall:
  - Linear vs circular: in a circle, positions are relative, no fixed start (so we often “fix” one person’s position to remove rotation).
- Redo 1–2 easy linear puzzles quickly.

---

### 2. Concept Block 1 – Basic Circular Seating (Facing Center) (30–40 min)

Learn:

- For n people in a circle:
  - Fix one person at a reference position (say top), arrange others around.
- “Immediate left/right” is **clockwise/anticlockwise**, depending on convention.

**Problem Type E: Circular Seating – Basic (Medium)**  
Solve 8–10 questions:

1. 6 people A–F sit around a circular table facing the center.  
   - A sits between B and C.  
   - D sits opposite A.  
   - E is second to the right of B.  
   - etc.  
   Determine arrangement or answer who sits where relative to whom.  
2. 5 or 7 people, with 4–5 constraints.

Key concepts:

- Always fix one person’s place (e.g., A at the top).
- Carefully mark directions: choose clockwise as “right”, anticlockwise as “left” (or vice versa), and stay consistent.

---

### 3. Concept Block 2 – Circular Seating (Some Facing In, Some Out) (30–40 min)

When some people face center and others face outward, **left/right flips** for outward-facing ones.

Rules:

- Facing center:
  - Left = anticlockwise, Right = clockwise (in standard drawings).
- Facing out:
  - Left = clockwise, Right = anticlockwise.

**Problem Type F: Mixed Facing Circular Puzzles (Medium–High)**  
Solve 5–7 questions.

Typical pattern:

1. 8 people sit around a circle, some facing center, some facing outward.  
   - A sits second to the right of B.  
   - C sits third to the left of D, etc., with given facing directions.  
   Questions ask: Who sits opposite E? Who is to the immediate left of F?

Key concepts:

- For each person, note facing direction near their name.
- Carefully apply left/right based on facing.

> Work **slowly and neatly** on these at first; they’re common in tests and error-prone.

---

### 4. Independent Thinking Task (10–15 min)

- Build a simple circle puzzle:
  - 4 or 5 people, all facing center.
  - Write 3–4 constraints.
- Then, change one person to face outward and modify any one clue to reflect left/right.
- Solve both variants and compare complexity.

---

### 5. Short Timed Drill (10–15 min)

- 5 circular seating puzzles (3 basic, 2 with mixed-facing if comfortable).
- Time: **15 minutes**.
- Aim:
  - At least **understand all constraints** even if you don’t fully solve every puzzle in time.

---

## Day 4 – Tabular / Grid Puzzles (Person vs City vs Color etc.)

**Focus:** Puzzles where you map multiple attributes (e.g., Name–City–Profession).

### 1. Warm-up (10–15 min)

- Redo 1 linear + 1 circular puzzle to get into LR mode.
- Recall how you used a **table** for Person vs Fruit earlier.

---

### 2. Concept Block 1 – 2D Grid Method (30–40 min)

Learn:

- Common structure:  
  - People: A, B, C, D  
  - Attributes: City (Pune, Delhi, etc.), Color (Red, Blue, etc.)  
- Draw table with People as rows, attributes as columns.

**Problem Type G: 2-Attribute Table Puzzle (Medium)**  
Solve 6–8 puzzles.

Example structure:

1. 4 friends A, B, C, D each live in a different city (Pune, Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai) and like a different color (Red, Blue, Green, Yellow).  
   Clues like:  
   - A does not live in Delhi or Mumbai.  
   - The one from Pune likes Red.  
   - B is from Chennai.  
   - C likes Blue, etc.  
   Deduce city & color for each.

Key concepts:

- Mark X where combinations are impossible.
- When one attribute is fixed (e.g., B is from Chennai), fill entire row/column accordingly.
- Use **process of elimination**.

---

### 3. Concept Block 2 – 3-Attribute Table Puzzle (30–40 min)

**Problem Type H: 3-Attribute Grid (Medium–High)**  
Solve 4–6 puzzles.

Example pattern:

- 5 people with attributes:
  - City
  - Profession
  - Favorite Sport

With 7–10 clues, you have to fill in entire grid.

Key concepts:

- Work systematically:
  1. Write all possibilities as rows/columns.  
  2. Start with the most concrete clues (“A is doctor from Delhi”).  
  3. Then use exclusive info (“The engineer doesn’t live in Mumbai”).  
  4. Frequently re-scan clues for newly-usable info.

> Don’t try to hold all info in your head; write everything in the table.

---

### 4. Independent Thinking Task (10–15 min)

- Start designing a simple table puzzle:
  - 3 people, 3 cities, 3 favorite fruits.
  - Write 5–6 clues that together determine unique mapping.
- Check if your clues are:
  - Too weak (multiple solutions)?  
  - Or too strong (some clues redundant)?

This improves your feel for puzzle structure.

---

### 5. Short Timed Drill (10–15 min)

- Do 2–3 tabular puzzles back-to-back.
- Give yourself **12–15 minutes** total.
- Focus:
  - Clean, well-organized tables.
  - Minimal overwriting and confusion.

---

## Day 5 – Selection/Distribution Puzzles & Basic Constraints

**Focus:** “Choose a group” puzzles with logical conditions (similar to combinatorics but with logic).

### 1. Warm-up (10–15 min)

- Recall combinations from Week 5:
  - nCk = number of ways to choose k out of n.
- But here focus is on **logic** (allowed vs not allowed), not counting.

---

### 2. Concept Block 1 – Group/Committee Selection with Conditions (30–40 min)

**Problem Type I: Selection under Constraints (Medium)**  
Solve 8–10 questions.

Typical patterns:

1. From 7 people A–G, a team of 4 is to be formed.  
   - A and B cannot both be in the team.  
   - If C is in, D must also be in.  
   List all possible combinations or answer if a given set is valid.  
2. From 6 candidates, at least one of X or Y must be chosen, but not both P and Q together, etc.

Key concepts:

- Translate conditions into logic:
  - “Cannot both” → not (A and B) simultaneously.
  - “If C is in, D must be in” → C → D.
- Handle via **casework**:
  - Case 1: C in (then D must be in)…  
  - Case 2: C not in (no restriction on D).

---

### 3. Concept Block 2 – Distribution with Basic Limits (30–40 min)

Simpler versions of:

- Assigning people to slots with basic “at most/at least” restrictions.

**Problem Type J: Distribution / Assignment Logic (Medium)**  
Solve 6–8 questions.

Examples:

1. 3 tasks must be assigned to 4 people A, B, C, D.  
   - A must get at least 1 task.  
   - D cannot do the third task.  
   Check if a proposed assignment is valid or count possible valid assignments (for small cases).  
2. 5 students sit in 5 chairs, but:
   - A and B cannot sit adjacent.  
   Are these 2–3 sample seatings valid/not valid?

Key concepts:

- Understand constraint effect more than exact count:
  - Identify quickly what violates a condition.

---

### 4. Independent Thinking Task (10–15 min)

- Take any group selection puzzle you solved.
- Rewrite it as:
  - “Is this specific team possible?” type question.
- Then modify conditions slightly (e.g., allow A and B together now, but require C to be excluded if D is included) and check again.

This forces you to think in IF–THEN logic terms.

---

### 5. Short Timed Drill (10–15 min)

- 8–10 questions: mix of Types I & J.
- Time: **12–15 minutes**.
- Aim:
  - Very clear parsing of conditions.
  - You should be able to quickly say “Valid / Not Valid” for given combinations.

---

## Day 6 – Blood Relations & Syllogisms

**Focus:** Family relationship puzzles and basic logical statements.

### 1. Warm-up (10–15 min)

- Family terms recap:
  - Parent, child, sibling, grandparent, uncle/aunt, nephew/niece, in-law.
- Do 2 very simple relation questions mentally.

---

### 2. Concept Block 1 – Blood Relations (30–40 min)

Learn:

- Draw **family tree**:
  - Generations as levels; horizontal lines for siblings; vertical for parent–child.
- Interpret statements like:
  - “X is the brother of Y’s mother” → X is Y’s maternal uncle.

**Problem Type K: Basic Blood Relations (Medium)**  
Solve 10–12 questions.

Examples:

1. Pointing to a woman, Ravi said, “Her husband’s brother is my mother’s only son.”  
   How is the woman related to Ravi?  
2. A is B’s sister. C is B’s mother. D is C’s father. E is D’s wife. How is E related to B?  
3. “He is my father’s only sister’s son.” What is the relation?

Key concepts:

- Convert complex sentences step-by-step in diagrams.
- Clearly distinguish male/female when mentioned.

---

### 3. Concept Block 2 – Syllogisms / Statement–Conclusion (30–40 min)

Learn basic syllogism pattern:

- Statements: e.g.,  
  “All A are B.”  
  “Some B are C.”  
- Decide which conclusions logically follow:
  - e.g., “Some A are C” – not necessarily true.

**Problem Type L: Simple Syllogisms (Medium)**  
Solve 10–12 problem sets.

Each set:

- 2–3 statements like:
  - All dogs are animals.  
  - Some animals are cats.  
- Conclusions:
  - Some dogs are cats.  
  - Some cats are animals.

You must mark each conclusion as:
- Definitely true
- Definitely false
- Or not certain (can’t be concluded)

Key concepts:

- Use **Venn diagrams** mentally or roughly on paper.
- Learn meaning of:
  - All, Some, No, Some not.

> Take care: in aptitude tests, “follows” means **must** be true in *every* possible diagram that satisfies the statements.

---

### 4. Independent Thinking Task (10–15 min)

- For blood relations:
  - Draw your own family tree.
  - Write 3 relational statements (like a puzzle) and ensure you can solve them using your tree.
- For syllogisms:
  - Create a simple pair of statements and two possible conclusions.
  - Check with quick Venn sketches if they must be true or not.

---

### 5. Short Timed Drill (10–15 min)

- 5–6 blood relation questions + 5–6 syllogism sets.
- Time: **15 minutes**.
- Focus:
  - Quick, clean diagrams.
  - No guesswork; rely on structure.

---

## Day 7 – Mixed LR Sets & Mini Mock

**Focus:** Combine LR topics and practice under time pressure with analysis.

### 1. Quick Revision (25–30 min)

Skim your notes & diagrams from the week:

- Linear & circular seating:
  - Representation methods, “fixing” positions, facing directions.
- Tabular puzzles:
  - Rows/columns, exclusion with X marks.
- Selection puzzles:
  - If–then constraints, mutual exclusion.
- Blood relations and syllogisms:
  - Family tree basics, Venn for logic.

Summarize in 2–3 pages.

---

### 2. Mixed Practice (25–30 min)

Solve **15–20 mixed questions**, untimed:

Suggested mix:

- 4–5 linear seating (some small, some normal-sized).
- 3–4 circular seating.
- 3–4 tabular puzzles (small).
- 2–3 selection puzzles.
- 2–3 blood relations or syllogisms.

As you solve:

- For each set, note:
  - Which representation worked best? (row slots, circle, table, tree)
  - Did you ever try to do too much in your head?

---

### 3. LR Mini Mock (30–40 min)

Create or use a small mock:

- **Total:** 20–25 LR questions (or 4–5 sets of 4–6 questions each).
  - 1–2 linear seating sets.
  - 1 circular seating set.
  - 1 tabular puzzle set.
  - 1–2 sets of miscellaneous (selection, blood relation, syllogism).

**Time:** 30–35 minutes.

Strategy:

- First 3–5 minutes:
  - Scan all sets.
  - Start with the one that looks **clearest** and least calculation-heavy.
- Don’t get stuck:
  - If a set is not clicking after 5–6 minutes, move on and come back later.

---

### 4. Detailed Analysis (30–40 min)

After the mock:

1. **Correct & Fast:**
   - Identify which patterns you are now comfortable with (e.g., 2-attribute table, basic linear seating).
2. **Correct but Slow:**
   - Was your diagram messy?
   - Did you consider too many cases?  
   - Re-solve with a more systematic approach.
3. **Wrong / Unsolved:**
   - Classify why:
     - Misinterpreted language (“to the right of” vs “right of X”)?  
     - Wrong “facing” logic in circle?  
     - Missed one clue in table?  
   - Immediately do 1–2 similar puzzles of that type correctly.

Finally, write:

- “Top 3 LR weaknesses after Week 6”, such as:
  - Mixed-facing circular puzzles.
  - 3-attribute tabular puzzles.
  - Complex selection with multiple logical conditions.

You’ll specifically target these in full mocks in Weeks 7–8.

---

If you’d like, next we can structure **Week 7 (Data Interpretation & Data Sufficiency) Day 1–Day 7** in the same detailed, step-by-step format.
